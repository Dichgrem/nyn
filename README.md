Do you want to get online at your school? (・∀・)  
Do you also want multiple devices online at once without being limited by login counts? (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑

Well, [nyn](https://github.com/diredocks/nyn) is designed just for you! (*≧ω≦)

**nyn** is a modern H3C 802.1x standard authentication client. The name stands for "I am Not Your Node," while the official H3C client is called iNode.
